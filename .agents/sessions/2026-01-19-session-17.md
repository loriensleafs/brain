## Work Summary

Session 17 orchestrated comprehensive embedding system improvements:

### Deliverables

1. **Strategic Evaluation**: REJECTED /memory-embeddings skill (3-agent consensus)
2. **ADR-002**: Batch API migration (59.2x performance improvement)
3. **ADR-003**: Task prefix for quality (search_document/search_query)
4. **edit_note trigger**: Auto-embedding on note edits
5. **Catch-up trigger**: Background sync on session start
6. **Session completion**: 7 sessions with complete checklists
7. **Artifact audit**: 36 spec status fields updated
8. **Governance**: Content attribution constraints added

### Agent Orchestration

- 40+ specialist delegations across 12 agents
- Parallel evaluation (3 agents) prevented wrong solution
- Sequential implementation after parallel planning
- Multiple QA validation rounds with all PASS verdicts

### Performance Results

- 700 notes: 600s → 10.13s (59.2x improvement)
- Exceeds 13x stretch goal by 4.5x
- Zero manual intervention for embedding sync
