## Work Log

### Bootstrap Session

**Status**: In Progress

**What was done**:

- Initialized Brain MCP with project "brain"
- Read agent documentation (AGENTS.md, AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md, AGENT-SYSTEM.md, orchestrator.md)
- Read SESSION-PROTOCOL.md
- Read HANDOFF note from Brain MCP
- Created this session log

**Decisions made**:

- Working on main branch is acceptable for bootstrap session
- Using Brain MCP note for HANDOFF since file doesn't exist in repo
