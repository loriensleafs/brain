## Work Log

### Bootstrap Session

**Status**: Complete

**What was done**:

1. Initialized Brain MCP with project "brain"
2. Read HANDOFF note from Brain MCP
3. Verified git state (branch: main, commit: 1f920cd)
4. Listed all available PowerShell scripts
5. Created this session log
6. Will list all Brain MCP tools

**Decisions made**:

- Working on main branch is acceptable for bootstrap session
- Using Brain MCP note for HANDOFF since file doesn't exist in expected location
