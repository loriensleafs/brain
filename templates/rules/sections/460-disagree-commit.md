### Disagree and Commit

When {{workers}} conflict: (1) All present positions with data, disagreements documented. (2) If no consensus, escalate to high-level-advisor for decision with documented rationale. (3) Once decided, ALL commit fully -- no passive-aggressive execution. Language: "I disagree with [approach] because [reasons], but I commit to executing [decided approach] fully."
