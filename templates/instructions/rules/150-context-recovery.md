### Context Recovery Quick Reference

| Question | Read |
|:--|:--|
| "What was decided before?" | `HANDOFF.md` |
| "What's the current task?" | `PROJECT-PLAN.md` |
| "How should I format commits?" | `.agents/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` |
| "What patterns work here?" | Brain memories (`mcp__plugin_brain_brain__search`) |
| "What happened last session?" | Session logs in `.agents/sessions/` |

**If you skip these reads, you WILL waste tokens rediscovering context that already exists.**

See **[.agents/SESSION-PROTOCOL.md](.agents/SESSION-PROTOCOL.md)** for full protocol with verification mechanisms, templates, and violation handling.
