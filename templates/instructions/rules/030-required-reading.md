### Required Reading

Before starting work, read these files in order:

1. `.agents/AGENT-SYSTEM.md` -- Full agent catalog, personas, and routing protocols
2. `.agents/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` -- Task execution rules, commit conventions, and quality standards
3. `.agents/SESSION-PROTOCOL.md` -- Session lifecycle, validation requirements, and violation handling

These files contain the complete operational details that this document summarizes. If a rule here seems ambiguous, the source file has the full specification.
