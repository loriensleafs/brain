## BLOCKING GATE: Initialization

**BEFORE doing ANY work**, you MUST:

```text
1. Skill(skill="brain:memory")
2. mcp__plugin_brain_brain__bootstrap_context  (with project path)
```

NON-NEGOTIABLE. Without this you lack project memories, semantic navigation, and historical context.

**For VS Code/Copilot**: If Brain MCP tools are available (`mcp__plugin_brain_brain__*`), initialize them first.
