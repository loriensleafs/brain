### Memory Operations in Agent Teams

Teammates have their own context windows and load CLAUDE.md and MCP servers automatically. This means teammates have direct access to Brain MCP tools.

| Context | Method | Rule |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **You (team lead)** | Brain MCP tools directly, or spawn a memory teammate | Use tools directly for simple operations. Spawn a memory teammate for complex multi-note operations. |
| **Teammates** | Brain MCP tools directly | Teammates load MCP servers from CLAUDE.md. They can read/write Brain notes without delegation. |
