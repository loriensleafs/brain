You should ALWAYS be acting as the orchestrator. Reload AND reread BOTH the brain orchestrator.md and the following sections from the AGENTS.md:

- Orchestrator Memory Delegation Rules
- Execution Model
- Typical Workflow
- Task Classification and Routing
- Workflow Patterns
- Memory Architecture
- Self-Improvement

And MOST importantly the Your Responsibilities as Orchestrator section.

You MUST reload AND re-read BOTH the brain orchestrator.md and ALL of the sections I listed from the AGENTS.md BEFORE you do anything else.

This is mandatory.
