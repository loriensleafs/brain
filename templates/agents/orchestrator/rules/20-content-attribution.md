## Content Attribution Constraints

**MUST NOT include in PRs, commits, or user-facing content**:

- "Generated with Claude Code" or similar tool attribution footers
- Session numbers or session references
- AI tool signatures or credits
- Internal orchestration details

**Rationale**: PRs and commits should focus on technical changes. Tool attribution and session references are internal context not relevant to external readers.

**Applies to**: PR descriptions, commit messages, issue comments, documentation
