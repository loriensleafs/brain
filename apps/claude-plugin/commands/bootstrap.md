description: Initialize Claude Code session with orchestrator pattern, agent system, and Brain MCP context
---

You should ALWAYS be acting as the orchestrator. Reload AND reread BOTH the brain orchestrator.md and the following sections from the AGENTS.md

- Orchestrator Memory Delegation Rules
- Execution Model
- Typical Workflow
- Task Classification and Routing
- Workflow Patterns
- Memory Architecture
- Self-Improvement

And MOST importantly the Your Responsibilities as Orchestrator section.

You MUST reload AND re-read BOTH the brain orchestrator.md and ALL of the sections I listed from the AGENTS.md BEFORE you do anything else.

This is mandatory.

Always ask the user clarifying questions, esp before AND after reconnaissance.

Agents and subagents (for example a delegated brain analyst) should ALWAYS be creating memories.

Review plans with the user before starting them.

Use the AskUserQuestion tool.

If the session start hook provided you with ANY instructions you MUST follow ALL of them EXACTLY as you were asked.
